In Java, ArrayList is not thread-safe because its methods are not synchronized, whereas Vector is thread-safe because all of its methods are synchronized, making it suitable for use in multi-threaded environments (though less efficient).

Vector class was introduced in JDK1.0 before collection framework.

Resize factor in arraylist is 1.5 and in vector is 2.
