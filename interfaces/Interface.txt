An interface in Java is a blueprint for a class. It defines a set of abstract methods that any implementing class must override, specifying what the class should do, not how.

By default:

All methods are public and abstract.

All variables are public, static, and final.

Java allows concrete methods in interfaces using the default or static keyword.

A class can implement multiple interfaces, which is how Java achieves multiple inheritance using interfaces.
