What is synchronized keyword?

The synchronized keyword in Java is used to control access to blocks of code or methods to ensure thread safety. When a method or block of code is declared as synchronized, only one thread at a time can execute it for a given object (or class, in the case of static synchronization).It ensures mutual exclusion on a shared resource.

Why Use synchronized?

In multithreaded programs, multiple threads may try to access shared resources (like variables, files, or databases) concurrently. Without proper synchronization, this can lead to data inconsistency or race conditions.

Synchronized method -->

public synchronized void update() {
    // only one thread can execute this at a time
}

Synchronized block -->

public void update() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // critical section
    }
}
