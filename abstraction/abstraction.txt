Abstract Class in Java:

Definition:
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly, meaning you can't create objects of it using new.

Abstract Methods:
It can contain abstract methods â€” methods without a body, just the signature.

Example:
abstract void makeSound();  // No body

Concrete Methods:
It can also contain regular methods with a body (unlike interfaces before Java 8).

Purpose:
Abstract classes are used to provide a common base class for other classes to extend, especially when you want to enforce some method structure but leave implementation to child classes.

abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound(); // abstract method
    
    void eat() {               // concrete method
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}
